# bconnect-DOMAIN-mcp (server template)

Skeleton for a new bConnect MCP server. The steps to turn it into a real server are at the
top of `src/index.ts`. Copy this README along with the code and keep the environment table
below in sync with what the new server reads. A test compares the table with the variables
the server's `src/` and `@bconnect/mcp-core` actually read, and fails on any difference.

The connection settings (base URL, credentials, CA certificate, TLS, audit level, rate limit)
are read by `clientConfigFromEnv()` in `@bconnect/mcp-core`. Don't read them in the server.

## Environment Variables

The variables this server reads (a test checks the list). Each is described, with its default, in [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](../docs/CONFIGURATION.md); the second column says only what is different in this server. When the HTTP gateway hosts the server, `MCP_TRANSPORT`, `MCP_PORT`, `MCP_BIND` and `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` have no effect, `ALLOW_WRITE_OPERATIONS` and `ALLOW_SECRET_READ` are ignored (always off), and the gateway's own settings apply ([Gateway](../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#gateway)).
