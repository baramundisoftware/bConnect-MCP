# bconnect-universaldynamicgroups-mcp

Part of the **bConnect MCP Suite** — exposes the baramundi bConnect V2.0 REST API to AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol.

**Domain:** Universal Dynamic Groups — UDG definitions and folder hierarchy  
**Tools:** 6 by default (no write tools)

> **Requires baramundi Management Suite 26R1 or later.** The server reads the bMS version
> from `GET /v2.0/ManagementServer` during its startup connectivity check and exits if it is
> older. There is no `BCONNECT_RELEASE` setting.

## Quick Start

```env
BCONNECT_BASE_URL=https://<your-bms-server>:443/bconnect
BCONNECT_USERNAME=mcp-reader
BCONNECT_PASSWORD=<password>
# Optional: BCONNECT_AUDIT_LEVEL=write   (all / write / security / none)
```

```bash
# Build from the repo ROOT. Every server imports @bconnect/mcp-core, so a
# server directory cannot be built on its own.
npm ci
npm run build -w @bconnect/mcp-core
npm run build -w bconnect-universaldynamicgroups-mcp

# Run it. Credentials come from the env file, never from the command line.
node --env-file=/path/to/bconnect.env bconnect-universaldynamicgroups-mcp/build/index.js
```

### Registering it with an MCP client

Every client starts the **same process**. What differs is which file the entry
goes in, the key it sits under, and whether the entry is typed:

```json
{
  "bconnect-universaldynamicgroups": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "node",
    "args": [
      "--env-file=/path/to/bconnect.env",
      "/opt/bconnect-mcp-suite/bconnect-universaldynamicgroups-mcp/build/index.js"
    ]
  }
}
```

| Client | File | Wrap the entry in | `"type"` |
|--------|------|-------------------|:----------:|
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` in the project root | `mcpServers` | keep |
| VS Code (Copilot agent mode) | `.vscode/mcp.json` | **`servers`** | keep |
| Claude Desktop | `claude_desktop_config.json` | `mcpServers` | drop |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | `mcpServers` | drop |
| Continue | `~/.continue/mcpServers/<name>.yaml` | `mcpServers`, a YAML **list** whose items each carry their own `name:` | keep |
| LibreChat | `librechat.yaml` | `mcpServers` | keep |

`servers` vs `mcpServers` is the usual silent failure: VS Code ignores an
`mcpServers` block without reporting anything. n8n, Open WebUI, OpenAI's hosted
tool and Copilot Studio have no stdio path at all and reach the suite over the
HTTP gateway instead — see the [suite README](../README.md#client-configuration).

> `--env-file` needs Node 20.6 or newer (22.15+ is recommended anyway). On an
> older Node, export the variables into the environment before launching.

> No credential appears in the entry above. A client config is not a secrets
> store — several of them are world-readable by default and some are committed
> to version control. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#credentials-at-rest-env-and-client-config).

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_universal_dynamic_groups` | List all Universal Dynamic Groups in baramundi |
| `get_universal_dynamic_group` | Get details of a specific UDG by GUID |
| `list_universal_dynamic_groups_by_folder` | List UDGs within a specific folder |
| `list_udg_folders` | List all UDG folders in baramundi |
| `get_udg_folder` | Get details of a specific UDG folder |
| `list_udg_folders_by_folder` | List sub-folders within a UDG folder |

---

**Surface change in 26.1.8.** Every `list_*` tool accepts `countOnly: true`, which
returns `{ totalItems, filters }` instead of a page of rows — a couple of hundred
bytes instead of a full page. This server is read-only, so the write gate
(`ALLOW_WRITE_OPERATIONS`) changes nothing about what it advertises.
